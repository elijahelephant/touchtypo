# Typo

This is my take on a touchscreen keyboard typo corrector. It reads in a
series of points  where the user touched the screen,  compare these with the
positions of the keys on the screen, and determine which words that the user was
most likely trying to type.


### Storage

The `Heap` class has a single `Entry*` to hold all of its data. Fortunately, you
can store binary heaps in arrays very efficiently.  The top of the heap lives at
index zero, its left child lives at index one, and so on. The entry at index `i`
has the following neighbors (if they exist):



There's a nice visualization on Wikipedia:

### Percolation

A min-heap has the property that every item is smaller than its children.  So if
you add or remove items from your heap,  you'll need to move them around to keep
this property.



### Functions

`Heap` member functions in `Heap.cpp`.

- The constructor creates an empty heap with the given capacity.
- The copy constructor makes a copy of an existing heap.
- The move constructor steals the memory from an existing heap.
- The `capacity()` function returns the maximum capacity of the heap.
- The `count()` function returns the number of items in the heap.
- The `lookup()` function returns a reference to the entry at a given index.
  If the index is invalid, it throws a `std::out_of_range` exception.
- The `pop()` function removes the entry with the lowest score and returns it.
  If there are no items in the heap, it throws a `std::underflow_error`.
- The `push()` function adds a new entry to the heap.  If there is no space for
  the new item, it throws a `std::overflow_error`.
- The `pushpop()` function is a more efficient version of a `pop()` followed by
  a `push()`.  Instead of replacing the popped entry with the last entry in the
  vector, it replaces it with the pushed entry, and then percolates that down.
  If there are no items in the heap, it throws a `std::underflow_error`.
- The `top()` function returns a reference to the entry with the lowest score.
  If there are no items in the heap, it throws a `std::underflow_error`.


## The Word List

Your word list is  declared in `WordList.h`.  It's a  simple class with
two important jobs: it holds a list of all valid words, and owns the `correct()`
function that translates sequences of points into probable words.


### Functions

Implement the `WordList` member functions in `WordList.cpp`.

- The constructor creates a word list from a words file.  Each line of this file
  is a single word.  It ignores words that are not entirely lower case ASCII.

- The `correct()` function  is where the important stuff happens.  It takes in a
  sequence of points; these are the points where the user touched the screen. It
  then finds all the words of the  correct length,  scores them according to the
  scoring algorithm below, and uses a `Heap` with capacity `maxcount` to collect
  the most likely words.  Words with scores lower than `cutoff` are not included
  in the output.


### Scoring

For every sequence  of touch points,  we can calculate  a similarity score for a
word of the same length.  To do this, first use the `QWERTY` map  in `Point.cpp`
to look up the location of the letters in the word on a QWERTY keyboard. You now
have two sequences of points:  one sequence of touch points, and one sequence of
key locations.

Then, calculate the Euclidean distance `d` between the first touch point and the
first key location.  Then convert this to a score `s` using the scoring equation
`s = 1 / (10 dÂ² + 1)`. Repeat this for the second touch point and the second key
location, and then the third, and so on.

The score for a word is the average (mean) score of all its letters;  these will
range from near-zero to one.  The higher the score, the better the match.

For example, to score the word `was` (the user was trying to type `wax`):

| Touch Point  | Letter | Key Location | `d`   | `s`   |
|--------------|:------:|--------------|------:|------:|
| (0.98, 0.02) | `w`    | (1.00, 0.00) | 0.028 | 0.992 |
| (0.28, 0.95) | `a`    | (0.25, 1.00) | 0.058 | 0.967 |
| (1.71, 2.03) | `s`    | (1.25, 1.00) | 1.128 | 0.073 |

In this case, the word score is (0.992 + 0.967 + 0.073) / 3 = 0.677.
